# UnitTest

This directory stores all the unit test cases for this repository.

Use `@pytest.marker.local` to decorate a test function if you don't want to run it 
(either too slow or impossible) on CI/CD like GitHubAction.

To run all test cases, go to root directory of this repository, and run `pytest`.
